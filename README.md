## 🌀 Animated Rotating Logo – *Erasmus Guide*

This repository contains the **animated rotating logo** developed for the *Erasmus Guide* application — an app designed to support Erasmus students by helping them discover key educational and recreational locations in their new city.

### 🔁 Motion Concept

The logo features a **circular structure**, symbolizing global unity and exploration. The typography is arranged in a **counterclockwise path**, reflecting the reversal of confusion and the discovery of direction. The continuous rotation metaphorically represents the student’s journey of adaptation and growth.

### 🛠 Technologies Used

The logo animation is fully implemented in **SwiftUI** and **Xcode**, utilizing:

- `SwiftUI` — for compositional layout and rendering  
- `CoreAnimation` — to drive the continuous counterclockwise rotation  
- `CoreMotion` — to enable subtle motion response when the device is tilted  
- `CAKeyframeAnimation` — for smooth, natural rotation cycles  
- Custom `Timing Curves` — to simulate organic movement and momentum

### 🎯 Purpose & User Experience

The rotating logo isn’t just decorative — it creates a sense of **motion, orientation, and emotional familiarity**. Through its gyroscope-aware interaction and continuous movement, it invites users into a space of dynamic discovery, right from the moment they launch the app.
